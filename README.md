# Tri-Threads
"Tri-Threads" is a school project written in Java (the title is in French, the translation is "threads sort"). The goal of this project was create a custom list of random numbers, separate the list according to the amount of thread we wish to use, use a "Selection sort" for every thread and then use a "Merge sort" to bring every lists back together. The purpose was to measure the amount of time each threads will save to execute a program. 

I will not post the official requirements and the official report in case my teacher decides to re-use this project in the future. If you require the requirements or the report for any reason, don't hesitate to contact me: samuel.bernier@hotmail.com. 

## Important note
The program was done in a French university. Therefor, the program is also written in French.
